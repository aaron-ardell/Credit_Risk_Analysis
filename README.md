## Synopsis:

We've been tasked with performing data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning to assess credit card risk provided by the LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending service. First, we'll load the `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Next, we'll oversample the data using `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms. Third, we'll undersample the data using the `ClusterCentroids` algorithm. Then we'll oversample and undersample simultaneously with the `SMOTEENN` algorithm. Finally, we'll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias: `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EastEnsembleClassifier` to predict risk. Once we're done, we'll evaluate the performance of these models and assess which one should bne used to predict credit risk.
